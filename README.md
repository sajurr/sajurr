- 👋 Hi, I’m @sajurr
- 👀 I make science videos because I love to explain things in a simple and effective way. 
      I like to make illustrations that can help demonstrate the complexities of a lot of topics in physics and mathematics 
      and basically any subject that interests me.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ManimCE and python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that interest me.
